# TorchForge Documentation

**TorchForge** is a PyTorch-native platform built for post-training generative AI models and agentic development. Designed with the principle that researchers should write algorithms, not infrastructure.

```{note}
**Early Development:** TorchForge is currently experimental. Expect bugs, incomplete features, and API changes. Please file issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/forge) for bug reports and feature requests.
```

## Why TorchForge?

TorchForge introduces a "service"-centric architecture that provides the right abstractions for distributed complexity:

- **Usability for Rapid Research**: Isolate your RL algorithms from infrastructure concerns
- **Hackability for Power Users**: Modify any part of the RL loop without touching infrastructure code
- **Scalability**: Seamlessly shift between async and synchronous training across thousands of GPUs

## Quick Example

Here's what a simple SFT training run looks like:

```bash
# Download a model
uv run forge download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
  --output-dir /tmp/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

# Run supervised fine-tuning
uv run forge run --nproc_per_node 2 \
  apps/sft/main.py --config apps/sft/llama3_8b.yaml
```

See {doc}`getting_started` for complete installation and setup instructions.

## System Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Python** | 3.10+ |
| **Operating System** | Linux (tested on Fedora/Ubuntu) |
| **GPU** | NVIDIA with CUDA support |
| **Minimum GPUs** | 2 for SFT, 3 for GRPO |
| **Dependencies** | PyTorch nightly, Monarch, vLLM, TorchTitan |

## Supported Models
